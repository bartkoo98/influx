# Influx - articles about everything - stay closer to your favourite creators!

## About:
This is a project I am currently working hard on. Api works a bit like a
large collection of blogs, where each creator can add his articles on
various topics, start a discussion in the comments with readers, or
throw in short notes. My inspiration was the substack website. 
For now it is poor version which looks like typical blog, but I am working on improving it.
Now I am changing whole security, after I am going to add a lot of tests.
Soon:
* Subscription option to let the creator manage who can see the articles.
* Possibility of sending articles like newsletters.
* Register with email confirmation. Login with Google/Facebook account.
* Notifications.
